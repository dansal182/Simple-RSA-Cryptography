# Simple-RSA-Cryptography
Simple RSA cryptography program I wrote to better understand Java and OOP; it is based on the RSA encryption technology and includes an efficient way to compute modulus for large integers. The simple encryption is restricted to the twenty-six lower-case letters in the English alphabet-

The code is written in Java, and variable names, methods and attributes are in Spanish; the important transalations are: 
      llavepublica:= Public Key,
      frase:= Phrase,
      clave:= Numeric key/code to translate characters to numbers,
      Encriptar:= Encryption,
      Decriptar:= Decrypt.
